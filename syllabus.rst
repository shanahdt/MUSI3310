Course Objectives
=================

This course surveys predominantly European music in the nineteenth century. We will cover a breadth of composers (Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Berlioz, Wagner, and Verdi, among others), genres (solo instrumental, art song, choral, instrumental chamber music, concerto, symphony, opera), nations and regions (France, Germany and Austria, Italy, Russia, North America), and topics (salon culture, virtuosity, folk music, orientalism, musical meaning, memorialization, etc.). Ability to read scores is required; Theory 1 (MUSI 3310) strongly recommended as a prerequisite. 

For music majors: This course fulfills either the first historical requirement or an elective requirement.

Enrollment deadlines: The last day in the College to add a course is Wednesday, February 1; the last day to drop a course is Thursday, February 2; the last day to withdraw from a course is Wednesday, March 14.


Resources
=========

The following texts are required and are available either at the UVa Bookstore or through online sellers.

Required Text
---------

Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Nineteenth Century* (Oxford, 2009; paperback, ISBN 0195384830)


Suggested Reading
---------

Carl Dahlhaus, *Nineteenth-Century Music* (University of California Press, 1991; paperback, ISBN 0520076443)

Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Western World* (Schirmer, 2007; paperback, 2nd edition, ISBN 053458599X)


Note that while I encourage building a library of such important musicological texts, these books can be quite expensive. I will work to put as much of these suggested readings on either this website or Collab, along with musical scores. For the listening assignments, I will direct you either to a streaming database to which the UVa library subscribes, or good quality recordings on YouTube. Links will also be made available on the course website. 

**NOTE:** If you have difficulty locating material for this course, please let me know immediately by email.


Website
=======

The course website can be found at
http://shanahdt.github.io/MUSI3030/. This site contains lectures, course materials, supplementary readings, quizzes and assignments **for self assessment**, and helpful links. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, Collab.


Assistance
========

I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able to answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. Additionally, I am happy to set up an
appointment at a time that is mutually acceptable for more lengthy
discussions.
