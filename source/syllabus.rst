Texts
-------
The following texts are required and are available either at the UVa Bookstore or the Copy Shop (or, in the case of
the score, through online seller):

Reader collecting summaries of theory material and assignments; J. Haydn, *Piano Sonatas*, Vol. 2.
**The Reader is Only Available at The Copy Shop (5 Elliewood Ave)**


**NOTE:** If you have difficulty locating material for this course, please let me know immediately by email.


Website
--------

The course website can be found at
http://shanahdt.github.io/MUSI3310/. This site contains lectures, 
course materials, supplementary readings, quizzes and assignments 
**for self assessment**, and helpful links. 
It is intended to complement, rather than replace, Collab.

Policies and Grading
=====================

It is very easy for music theory and analysis to become overwhelming if one is not 
accustomed to working with it on a regular basis. In order to avoid falling behind, 
you are expected to come to all class meetings, and return all written assignments 
promptly.

**There will be frequent written assignments, three quizzes, and one final exam this semester.**
Assigments and tests will receive numerical grades (100 = perfect).

The breakdown of grades for this class is as follows:

- Assignments (40%)
- Quizzes (30%)
- Final Exam (30%)

Late Assignments
------------------

Assignments not turned at the beginning of 
the class in which they are due will lose 4 points.
If the assignments are still not turned in by the beginning of the next class 
after it's due, they will not be accepted at all. Exceptions are granted only in 
special circumstances, which must be prearranged with me.

Revising and Resubmitting Assignments
-----------------------------------------

You may revise or redo most assignments for a new grade, with the following rules: 

1. The new grade replaces the old grade (unless the new grade is lower, in which case there is no change). 
2. The highest grade possible on a redone assignment is 92.
3. The deadline for turning in a revision is the beginning of the next class after the first attempt was returned (e.g. if you received graded work on a Monday, the latest you can turn in your revision is the following Wednesday). 
4. The revisions must be neat and legible.
5. If the revision is on a separate page the original assignment must be turned in along with the revision (staples or paperclips are preferred, as piles of paper scare me). 
6. If the original grade dropped because the assignment was late, the same penalty applies to any revision. In cases where the grading of the original assignment reveals the correct answers (for instance, true-false questions) you cannot revise.

Attendance
-----------

Attendance is required.  You may miss at most two classes, unless 
you have a written excuse from a health care provider or another 
authorized excuse as arranged with the teacher.  
Consistent unexcused absences will cause your final grade to drop.

Assistance
-----------
I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. 
We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able to 
answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. Please feel free to visit 
me during office hours at any point during the semester.Additionally, I am happy to set up an
appointment at a time that is mutually acceptable for more lengthy
discussions.
